## ðŸ§  ML Strategy Logic

### Signal Generation
1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract 50+ features from market data
2. **Price Prediction**: LSTM model predicts next price movement
3. **Regime Detection**: Identify current market conditions
4. **Signal Fusion**: Combine predictions with confidence weighting
5. **Risk Assessment**: Adjust position size based on regime and confidence
6. **Signal Output**: Generate trading signal with stop-loss and take-profit

### Adaptive Behavior
- **Bull Market**: Favor long positions, normal position sizes
- **Bear Market**: Favor short positions, reduced position sizes
- **Sideways Market**: Higher confidence threshold, smaller positions
- **Volatile Market**: Much higher confidence threshold, minimal positions

## ðŸ”„ Model Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Models are created with default parameters
2. **Training**: Models learn from historical market data (100+ data points needed)
3. **Prediction**: Models generate real-time trading signals
4. **Update**: Models continuously learn from new market data
5. **Retraining**: Automatic retraining when performance degrades
6. **Persistence**: Models are saved/loaded for continuity

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Tracking

The system tracks:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Model Confidence**: Overall model reliability
- **Feature Importance**: Which indicators matter most

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

- **Minimum Data**: Need at least 100 historical data points for training
- **Training Time**: Initial training may take several minutes
- **Confidence Threshold**: Default 60% confidence for signal generation
- **Auto-Retraining**: Models retrain automatically when performance degrades
- **Model Storage**: Models are saved to `./models/` directory
